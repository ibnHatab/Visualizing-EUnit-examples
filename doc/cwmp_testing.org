** UTest for CWMP decoder
   
   Those tast was primaty drive during developmen and remains only in
   form of minimal test preserved within particular module for
   purporse of mainenance.
      

** CT and Regression Testing

   The Common Test framework (CT) is a tool which supports
   implementation and automated execution of test cases towards
   arbitrary types of target systems. The CT framework is based on the
   OTP Test Server and it's the main tool being used in all testing-
   and verification activities that are part of Erlang/OTP system
   development- and maintenance.

** Continuos Integration

   Continuous integration (CI) is the practice, in software
   engineering, of merging all developer workspaces with a shared
   mainline several times a day. It was first named and proposed as
   part of extreme programming (XP).

   Travis CI: A hosted continuous integration service for the open
   source community.  Travis VMs provide 32-bit Erlang OTP releases
   R14B04, R14B03 and R14B02 built using kerl.  

   [[https://travis-ci.org/andreeni/cpe_host][Continuos integration status: andreeni/cpe_host]] for Generic Debug,
   Trace, Logging, ProcRegistry for small equipment.
   
   Once the code is built, all tests should run to confirm that it
   behaves as the developers expect it to behave.
