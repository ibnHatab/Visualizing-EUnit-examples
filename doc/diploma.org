#+TITLE: CPE WAN Management Protocol: Augmented Test-driven Development.




* Abstract

This development uses xUnit and Property-based testing to make two
contributions.  

First we augment design process with system property discovering aid,
that provides feedback and guide developer from formal specification
to the exact component design.

Secondly, we re-factor Test Suite used during development phase into
Acceptance Test for the very same component. This has the effect of
transforming short living unitary tests into permanent regression test
framework with tight link to original specification.
